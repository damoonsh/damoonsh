## Mini Introduction

Computer Science student at [Ryerson University](https://www.ryerson.ca/), Toronto, ON, Canada.  
I have done projects in Web/Mobile Develoment and Data Science.   
Currently I am working on my programming skills by doing practice questions in Python and Rust.  
Kaggle competitions is something that I try to do as often as I can.


# Data
I took two courses on Coursera (Introduction to ML and Deep Learning specialization) to gain a basic knowledge of Machine Learning/Artifial Intelligence (and related sub-fields). After finishing those courses, I started reading Research papers, books and online documentations for popular frameworks ([TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html), [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_intro.html), etc.) to deepen my knowledge. 

- For Deep Learning, I am familiar and have coded with TensorFlow (Keras) and PyTorch. Alongside these two main DL frameworks, I have used libraries for data augmentation (for Computer Vision mainly) such as [albumentations](https://albumentations.ai/).
- For general Data Analytic projects, I use NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and sklearn.
- For gradient Boosting Model, I have used XGBoost, [CatBoost](https://catboost.ai/), Random Forests, and [lightBGM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Features.html).

Alongside these readings, [Kaggle Competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) have been helpful for applying the theoretical knowledge gained from all of these resources. Some of the kaggle competitions that I have done:

- ***[Halite Competition](https://github.com/damoonsh/Halite)***: Reinforcement Learning competition where bots would compete against each other to gain the most halite.
- ***[Mechanisms of Action](https://github.com/damoonsh/MoA)***: A novel approach to medical drug categorizing. 
- ***[Kaggle-Survey-2020](https://github.com/damoonsh/Kaggle-Survey-2020)***: Analysis of the released dataset of 20,000 people surveyed on kaggle website about their Data Science skills.
- ***[INGV - Volcanic Eruption Time](https://github.com/damoonsh/Volcano)***: Signal Data of 10,000 volcano were provided and we were to process the data and predict each volcano's eruption time.
- ***[Boston Housing Competition](https://github.com/damoonsh/Housing-Competition)***: Ongoing and famous public dataset where the price of houses are predicted using the given features.
- ***[Cassava Leaf Disease Classification](https://github.com/damoonsh/Cassava-Leaf-Disease-Classification)***: Multi Image Classification competition where the type of disease for any given leaf should be categorized using Computer Vision.

# Web/Mobile

I have gone through numerous online courses and documentations to learn about both the frontend and backend of Websites/Applications. Vue, React, and Node JS are some of the web stack that I have familiried myself with. For mobile development, Flutter is the framework that I taught myself by going through its own tutorials and documentations.

### Web
- ***[StockER](https://github.com/damoonsh/StockER)***: 
    - Desktop app written in **Electron/express** backend and **Vue** frontend.
    - Aims to provide a platform for investors and stock traders to keep track of their assets
    - News is fed to the pages via the NewsAPI
- ***[Vue-Calculator](https://github.com/damoonsh/Vue-Calculator)***: Simple calculator made using **Vue**.
- ***[Lyric Search App](https://github.com/damoonsh/Lyric-search-app)***: 
    - Basic app that finds the song when entered the relative lyrics.
    - Written in **React** using **Node** backend

### Mobile
- ***[Newss](https://github.com/damoonsh/Newss)***:
    - Used api calls to bring in the latest news articles.
    - Rendered the articles using Flutter widgets
    - Implemented a basic search engine within the app for the users to search for any news they want
    - Made a favorite tab to keep track of user's favorite news articles.
