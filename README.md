## Introduction

Computer Science student at [Ryerson University](https://www.ryerson.ca/), Toronto, ON, Canada. Interested in:

# Programming Languages
- **Python**: Done several courses with at University. As well as most of my personal projects.
- **Rust**: Was introduced to this course in ***Comparative Programming Languages*** at University, currently doing some practice projects.
- **R**: Use it mostly for low-level data visualization as well as data processing. Also, I teach R at Ryerson's bootcamps with a focus on business-related applications.
- **Java/C/C++/Bash**: University courses
- **JavaScript/HTML/CSS/SQL**: Taught myself these stacks for web development
- **MatLab**: Took Applied Linear Algebra (MTH719) and programmed in MatLab. Also, did some programming SVM, Regression, and K-means algorithm

# Data
I took two courses on Coursera (Introduction to ML and Deep Learning specialization) to gain a basic knowledge of Machine Learning (and related sub-fields). After finishing the courses, I started reading Research papers, books and online documentations ([TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html), [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_intro.html), etc.) to deepen my knowledge. 

- For Deep Learning, I am familiar and have coded with TensorFlow (Keras) and PyTorch. Alongside these two main DL frameworks, I have used libraries for data augmentation (for Computer Vision mainly) such as [albumentations](https://albumentations.ai/).
- For general Data Analytic projects, I use NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and sklearn.
- For gradient Boosting Model, I have used XGBoost, [CatBoost](https://catboost.ai/), Random Forests, and [lightBGM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Features.html).

Alongside these readings, [Kaggle Competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) have been helpful for applying the theoretical knowledge gained from all of these resources. Some of the kaggle competitions that I have done:

- ***[Halite Competition](https://github.com/damoonsh/Halite)***: Reinforcement Learning competition were bots would compete against each other to gain the most halite.
- ***[Mechanisms of Action](https://github.com/damoonsh/MoA)***: A novel approach to medical drug categorizing. 
- ***[Kaggle-Survey-2020](https://github.com/damoonsh/Kaggle-Survey-2020)***: Analysis of the released dataset of 20,000 people surveyed on kaggle website about their Data Science skills.
- ***[INGV - Volcanic Eruption Time](https://github.com/damoonsh/Volcano)***: Signal Data of 10,000 volcano were provided and we were to process the data and predict each volcano's eruption time.
- ***[Boston Housing Competition](https://github.com/damoonsh/Housing-Competition)***: Ongoing and famous public dataset where the price of houses are predicted using the given features.
- ***[Cassava Leaf Disease Classification](https://github.com/damoonsh/Cassava-Leaf-Disease-Classification)***: Multi Image Classification competition where the type of disease for any given leaf should be categorized using Computer Vision.

# Web
- ***HTML/CSS***: Took a course in University, also went over numerous YouTube tutorials.
- ***Javascript***: Taught myself Javascript via online documentations and books. Familiar with `Vue` and `React` front-end libraries as well as `Node/Express` backend libraries. 
- ***Typescript***: It was interesting that all the Javascript frameworks released a Typescript support, so I learnt this technology via the documentation on its own website.
- ***Flask***: Have a working knowledge server and API setup.

Some web-related projects:
- ***[StockER](https://github.com/damoonsh/StockER)***: 
    - Desktop app written in **Electron/express** backend and **Vue** frontend.
    - Aims to provide a platform for investors and stock traders
    - News is fed to the pages via the NewsAPI
- ***[Vue-Calculator](https://github.com/damoonsh/Vue-Calculator)***: Simple calculator made using **Vue**.
- ***[Lyric Search App](https://github.com/damoonsh/Lyric-search-app)***: 
    - Basic app that finds the song when entered the relative lyrics.
    - Written in **React** using **Node** backend
