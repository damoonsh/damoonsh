## Mini Introduction

Computer Science student at [Ryerson University](https://www.ryerson.ca/), Toronto, ON, Canada.  
I have done projects in Web/Mobile Develoment and Data Science.   
Currently I am working on my programming skills by doing practice questions in Python and Rust.  
Kaggle competitions is something that I try to do as often as I can.
