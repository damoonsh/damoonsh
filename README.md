# Introduction

Computer Science students at [Ryerson University](https://www.ryerson.ca/), Toronto, ON, Canada. Interested in:

- **```Machine Learning```**: Regression, Gradient Boosting, and general problem solving using data excites me.
- **```Deep Learning```**: Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing are two fields that I constantly read about.
- **```Rust Programming Language```**: It is believed Rust has the capacity to replace C therefore it will have a huge impact on future technologies (This is also evident since Amazon invested in the programming language). Also, I find the debugging tools for Rust very interesting.
- **```Data Analytics```**: Aside from Machine Learning algorithms that find patterns within the data, cleaning and preprocessing data is an important factor in any Data Science project. Normalizing, scaling, and reducing dimension as well as feature engineering the data are some of the topics that I practice while doing [Kaggle Competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions).

# Skill Set

I have tkintered with different tools and concepts. My main passion is problem solving and challenging myself. Building Web apps, competitive programming and working data-related projects are some topics that excite me.

I tend to read books, online documentations, and research papers to learn about a new tool or an Machine Learning algorithm. After Learning a new Machine Learning algorithm, I find a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and try to apply the theoretical concepts to the real-world application via coding.

# Data
I took two courses on Coursera (Introduction to ML and Deep Learning specialization) to gain a basic knowledge of Machine Learning (and related sub-fields). After finishing the courses, I started reading Research papers, books and online documentations ([TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html), [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_intro.html), etc.) to deepen my knowledge. 

- For Deep Learning, I am familiar and have coded with TensorFlow (Keras) and PyTorch. Alongside these two main DL frameworks, I have used libraries for data augmentation (for Computer Vision mainly) such as [albumentations](https://albumentations.ai/).
- For general Data Analytic projects, I use NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and sklearn.
- For gradient Boosting Model, I have used XGBoost, [CatBoost](https://catboost.ai/), Random Forests, and [lightBGM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Features.html).

Alongside these readings, [Kaggle Competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) have been helpful for applying the theoretical knowledge gained from all of these resources. Some of the kaggle competitions that I have done:

- ***[Halite Competition](https://github.com/damoonsh/Halite)***: Reinforcement Learning competition were bots would compete against each other to gain the most halite.
- ***[Mechanisms of Action](https://github.com/damoonsh/MoA)***: A novel approach to medical drug categorizing. 
- ***[Kaggle-Survey-2020](https://github.com/damoonsh/Kaggle-Survey-2020)***: Analysis of the released dataset of 20,000 people surveyed on kaggle website about their Data Science skills.
- ***[INGV - Volcano Eruption Time Prediction](https://github.com/damoonsh/Volcano)***: Signal Data of 10,000 volcano were provided and we were to process the data and predict each volcano's eruption time.
- ***[Boston Housing Competition](https://github.com/damoonsh/Housing-Competition)***: Ongoing and famous public dataset where the price of houses are predicted using the given features.

# Web
- ***HTML/CSS***: Took a course in University, also went over numerous YouTube tutorials.
- ***Javascript***: Taught myself Javascript via online documentations and books. Familiar with `Vue` and `React` front-end libraries as well as `Node/Express` backend libraries. 
- ***Typescript***: It was interesting that all the Javascript frameworks released a Typescript support, so I learnt this technology via the documentation on its own website.
- ***Flask***: Have a working knowledge server and API setup.

Some web-related projects:
- ***[StockER](https://github.com/damoonsh/StockER)***: 
    - Desktop app written in **Electron/express** backend and **Vue** frontend.
    - Aims to provide a platform for investors and stock traders
    - News is fed to the pages via the NewsAPI
- ***[Vue-Calculator](https://github.com/damoonsh/Vue-Calculator)***: Simple calculator made using **Vue**.
- ***[Lyric Search App](https://github.com/damoonsh/Lyric-search-app)***: 
    - Basic app that finds the song when entered the relative lyrics.
    - Written in **React** using **Node** backend
