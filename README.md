# Introduction

Secind year Computer Science students at [Ryerson University](https://www.ryerson.ca/), Toronto, ON, Canada. Interested in:

- Machine Learning: Regression, Gradient Boosting, and general problem solving using data excites me.
- Deep Learning: Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing are two fields that I am constantly read about.
- Rust Programming Language: I bielive Rust has the capacity to replace C. Also, I enjoy the debugging tools of Rust.
- Data Analytics: Aside from algorithms that find patterns within the data, cleaning and preprocessing the data is an important factor in any Data Science project. Normalizing, scaling, and reducing dimension as well as feature engineering the data are some of the topics that I practice while doing [Kaggle Competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions).

# Skill Set

I have tkintered with different tools and concepts. My main passion is problem solving and challenging myself. Building Web apps, competitve programming and doing data-related projects are at the center of my interest.

### Data
I took two courses on Coursera (Introdution to ML and Deep Learning specialization) to get me started in the field

### Web
- HTML/CSS: Took a course in University, also went over numerous Youtube tutorials.
- Javascript: Taught myself Javascript via online documentations and books. Familiar with Vue and React front-end libraries as well as Node/Express backend libraries. 
- Typescript: It was interesting that all the Javascript frameworks released a Typescript support, so I learnt this technology via the documentation on its own website.
- Flask: Have a workign knowledge server and API setup.
